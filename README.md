# Virt

Youâ€™ll want to set up your OpenAI API key. A quick way is to create an `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Then you can add it as an environment variable like this:

```shell
source .env
```

Next run Quarkus in development mode:

```shell
quarkus dev
```

Or with Gradle:

```shell
./gradlew quarkusDev
```
